A dashboard for the IAM NG project, interfacing with the API and Keycloak (https://github.com/indigo-iam/iam-ng).

## Getting started

To get started with the project - make sure you have installed NodeJS and npm.

Follow the docker-compose instructions [here](https://github.com/indigo-iam/iam-ng/blob/master/compose/README.md). Make sure to have added the appropriate entries to your /etc/hosts or platform equivilent. 

Clone the repository into a directory of your choosing

Run `npm ci` in the root of the cloned repository. This will install all the dependencies required for the project, into a node_modules folder. You may also wish to install the Angular CLI globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Edit appropriate configuration values in src/assets/app-config.json (does not need a recompile to take effect).

Run `ng serve` to run a local copy of the website on port 4000 with the Angular development server.

## Build

Production builds are automatically generated on every commit to master as GitHub artifacts. 
A docker image with a reverse proxy is also avaliable at: https://hub.docker.com/r/magicalwill/iam-dashboard
If you want to do it manually:
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This will open a dedicated Chrome window to run tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

n.b. there are currently no e2e tests configured

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
